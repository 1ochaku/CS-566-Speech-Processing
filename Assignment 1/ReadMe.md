# Assignment 1: Yes and No Prediction
1. As per the assignment, we had to analyse the audio files and detect whether the given audio file was yes or no.
2. For that, I applied the zcr and energy concept by finding the threshold for both and comparing the adjacent sample values.
3. The threshold was found through experimental analysis.
